                                   VERSIONING

sushi's version consists of three parts -- X.Y.Z -- which have the following
meanings:

  X: Protocol version -- increased for non-backwards-compatible protocol changes
  Y: Protocol version -- increased for backwards-compatible protocol changes
  Z: Bugfix version   -- increased for bugfixes

These versions are increased only once between releases.
All releases of the form X.Y.* belong to the same release series.

                                    FREEZES

Several freezes are in effect for a release series after the first release of
this series is made. The following restrictions apply:

  * No big, disruptive changes (for example, major new features) are allowed.
