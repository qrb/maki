                               CLIENT GUIDELINES

Clients should -- to the extent possible -- only rely on signals. For example, a
new window should be opened whenever a join signal is received and not only when
the user joins a channel in the client (for example, by typing "/join #foo").

Clients should not close windows automatically. For example, on receiving part
or quit signals, the corresponding windows should remain open.

Clients should forward unknown commands via the raw method. For example, if the
user types /kline user@host, the client should call raw("KLINE user@host").

Clients should check for the environment variable SUSHI_REMOTE_BUS_ADDRESS and
use its content as the bus address to connect to. If it is not set, they should
simply connect to the session bus.
