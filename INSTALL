                                  REQUIREMENTS

You will need the development libraries and headers of DBus, GLib and DBus-GLib.
On Debian-based systems these are available in the following packages:

* libdbus-1-dev
* libglib2.0-dev (>= 2.16)
* libdbus-glib-1-dev

                                  INSTALLATION

Just type "make", followed by "make install". This will install all the
necessary files in the /usr directory. Other directories can be specified by
calling make with the PREFIX variable, for example, "make PREFIX=/opt install".

# vi:textwidth=80:expandtab
