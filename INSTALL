                                  REQUIREMENTS

You will need the development libraries and headers of DBus, GLib and DBus-GLib.
On Debian-based systems these are available in the following packages:

* libdbus-1-dev
* libglib2.0-dev (>= 2.16)
* libdbus-glib-1-dev

                                  INSTALLATION

Just type "make", followed by "make install". This will install all the
necessary files in your home directory. Other directories can be specified by
calling make with the prefix variable, for example, "make prefix=/usr install".

# vi:textwidth=80:expandtab
